Open Issues:
Right now, we have a few open issues.
1. We are able to figure out what the training accuracy, validation accuracy, false positive rate, and true positive rate of the program is. However, what we would really like to figure out is what percentage of years the program will be able to classify the correct champion. Keep in mind that we have also found that some of the probabilities are equal, which means that the model might predict multiple champions for one year. That is an issue.
2. We need someone to write a better README that illustrates the structure of this code. What does every file do? What does the data mean?
3. We need a separate notebook for the feature selection. We already did it, but we need to rewrite it.
4. Instead of using max_depth as the stopping criterion, we should use pruning instead.
